            Making Golf Make Sense
          </h1>
          <strong
            >Golf has been a lifelong passion of mine - I've been playing
            recreationally for over 50 years!</strong
          >
          <br /><br />
          <p>
            My love for the game led me to take things a step further and in
            2022, I successfully earned my teaching certification through the
            National Registry of Professional Golf Instructors.<br /><br /> Over
            the past three years, I’ve taught private and semi-private lessons, led
            on-course playing sessions, and run a variety of fun, supportive clinics.
            My goal is simple: to help you build your skills and confidence, so you
            can enjoy playing golf with family, friends, and colleagues — and actually
            look forward to every round.
