        <p>
          Golf doesn’t have to be complicated or intimidating. I make learning
          the game simple, encouraging, and fun by breaking skills down into
          clear, easy steps. We’ll start with the basics — your grip, posture,
          and setup — and build a full swing that feels natural, consistent, and
          easy to repeat. With the right drills and tools, you’ll begin to feel
          your swing, trust it, and gain the confidence to enjoy the game on
          your own terms. My goal is to help you believe in your game, enjoy the
          process, and step onto the course with confidence and a smile.

          Your Lesson Experience
        </h1>
        <p>
          All lessons take place at a state-of-the-art indoor golf simulator in
          Burlington, Ontario. The rate is $125/hour, which includes simulator
          fees and taxes. You’re welcome to enjoy a private session — or bring a
          friend to share the experience and the cost! Lessons are paid in full
          at the time of booking in order to secure your spot. I love coaching
          indoors because the simulator provides detailed swing data and video
          feedback. This technology makes it easier to understand your swing
          mechanics and see real progress, faster.
